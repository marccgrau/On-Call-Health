              Our burnout detection system uses the <strong>On-Call Burnout (OCB) Score</strong>, a model designed specifically for
              engineering on-call work and incident response environments. The OCB framework is
              inspired by the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI), a scientifically validated tool for measuring personal and
              work-related burnout, but adapts those principles to operational data rather than survey responses.
              <br /><br />
              The OCB Score incorporates factors such as severity-weighted incident load, after-hours and weekend work,
              response-time pressure, recovery gaps between incidents, and compound-trauma effects from repeated critical events.
              This produces a real-time, practical burnout indicator tailored for modern DevOps and SRE teams.

            We analyze five specific factors that contribute to burnout in incident response teams. Each factor is measured
            on a scale of 0-10, with higher scores indicating greater burnout risk. These factors are then combined using
            the three-dimensional Copenhagen Burnout Inventory framework to produce an overall burnout score.

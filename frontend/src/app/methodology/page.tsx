Instead of reacting once people are already exhausted, the tool is designed to surface early signs that teams or individuals may be drifting into overload.`,

  overview: {
    title: "The Method Behind <em>Risk Level</em>",
    description: "A baseline-driven overload signal inspired by established research",
    paragraphs: [
      `On-Call Health computes a composite signal called <strong>Risk Level</strong>, derived from multiple <strong>Risk Signals</strong> and designed for engineering on-call and incident response work. The scoring approach is informed by established workload and burnout research, including the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI), but it is adapted to operational telemetry rather than survey-only measurement. Risk Level is not a medical tool and should not be used for diagnosis—its purpose is to surface <strong>trend drift</strong> that may indicate unsustainable on-call load.`,
      `The composite signal incorporates factors such as incident volume and severity, after-hours and weekend interruptions, and sustained periods of elevated operational activity. These inputs are evaluated over time and interpreted relative to individual and team baselines, because what is "normal" varies significantly across organizations and responders.`,
    ],
    callout: `<strong>Multi-Source Analysis:</strong> On-Call Health can ingest signals from tools like Rootly and PagerDuty as primary sources, with additional context from GitHub, Slack, Linear, and Jira when available. The model adapts to whichever integrations you enable, providing visibility into workload patterns without requiring a single "perfect" data source.`,
  },

  // Key Workload Signals section
  factors: {
    title: "Risk Signals",
    intro: `On-Call Health analyzes a set of <strong>operational workload signals</strong> that commonly contribute to on-call overload. They are tracked over time and interpreted relative to <strong>individual and team baselines</strong> to surface meaningful changes.`,
    subintro: `Rather than assigning universal scores or "healthy" thresholds, the system focuses on <strong>trend drift</strong>—how patterns evolve compared to what is normal for a given team or responder.`,

        iconColor: "text-blue-500",
        title: "Incident Volume",
        description: `Tracks the frequency of incidents handled over time. Sustained increases in incident volume often indicate rising operational load and reduced opportunity for recovery, especially when combined with other signals.`,

      },
      {
        icon: "Clock",

        description: `Captures work performed outside normal working hours, including evenings, nights, and weekends. This includes incident responses as well as related operational activity. Persistent off-hours work can reduce recovery time and contribute to cumulative fatigue, especially when it becomes a consistent pattern rather than an exception.`,
        detail: `<strong>How We Determine Off-Hours:</strong> On-Call Health retrieves each user's timezone from their Rootly or PagerDuty profile settings (with Rootly taking priority). Activities are then evaluated against standard business hours (9 AM to 5 PM by default) in the user's local timezone. This ensures that an engineer in San Francisco and one in Paris are both correctly assessed based on their respective local times. The business hours thresholds are configurable via environment variables for organizations with non-standard working hours.`,

        detail: `Rather than enforcing a fixed response-time threshold, On-Call Health looks at how response patterns change over time for a given responder or team.`,
        question: `Is the pressure to respond quickly increasing or becoming more sustained over time?`,

        title: "Severity-Weighted Incident Load",
        description: `Accounts for the fact that not all incidents carry the same operational and cognitive burden. Higher-severity incidents generally demand more attention, longer focus, and greater emotional investment than lower-severity events.`,
        question: `Is the proportion of high-severity incidents increasing relative to normal patterns?`,
      },
    ],
    conclusion: {
      title: "How These Signals Are Used",
      description: `These signals are combined into a <strong>composite workload view</strong> and evaluated relative to historical baselines. The goal is to reduce noise and highlight changes that may warrant attention, not to label or rank individuals.`,
      callout: `A sustained negative trend across one or more signals—especially when combined with changes in self-reported check-ins—can indicate that on-call load is becoming unsustainable and may require investigation or adjustment.`,
    },

  // Research enhancements section
  enhancements: {
    title: "Risk Level Formula",
    intro: `The Risk Level is a metric specific to On-Call Health—it is not a clinically validated health metric or diagnostic tool. We took inspiration from research-led frameworks (including the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory and first responder stress studies) and adapted them to the specific needs of incident responders. We share this methodology so you have full clarity on how scores are calculated. Since On-Call Health is open source, you're free to adjust the weights and thresholds to fit your team's needs.`,

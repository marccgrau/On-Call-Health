Catch exhaustion before it burns out your incident responders.

On-Call Health integrates with Rootly, PagerDuty, GitHub, Slack, Linear, and Jira to collect objective and self-reported data to identify signs of overload among on-call engineers. Free and open-source.

Get started at [www.oncallhealth.ai](https://www.oncallhealth.ai/) or [self-host it.](#Installation)

##  Methodology

On-call Health measures overwork risk in professional settings. On-call Health isn't a medical or diagnostic tool; it is designed to help identify patterns and trends that may suggest overwork.

The tool is centered around 2 main metrics:
* **On-Call Health (OCH) Score** — A composite score derived from all collected signals, reflecting an individual's incident response workload.

* **Score Trend** — How the OCH score evolves over time relative to each responder's own baseline.

The OCH score measures workload, not well-being directly. People respond differently to incidents, after-hours work, and pressure; some thrive under high-severity incidents, while others don't. The score trend captures whether someone's workload is shifting from *their* normal, regardless of where that normal sits.

##  Data Collection

* **Incident Response:** Volume, severity, time-to-acknowledge, time-to-resolve, after-hours pages, consecutive on-call days (PagerDuty, Rootly)

* **Work Patterns:** After-hours and weekend activity, commit/message timing distribution, on-call shift frequency (Rootly, PagerDuty, GitHub, Slack)

* **Workload:** Active issues assigned, PR volume and size, commit frequency, code review participation (Jira, Linear, GitHub)

* **Self-Reported Wellbeing**: Feeling and workload scores, stress factors, personal circumstances (Slack surveys)
